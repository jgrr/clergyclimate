<p>It is the consensus of the worldâ€™s climate scientists that we are experiencing climate change and that humans are significant contributors to this change.  The global burning of fossil fuels over the last two centuries has brought untold benefits to humanity, but has also raised the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere higher than they have been in thousands, perhaps millions of years. Humanity is conducting an unprecedented and possibly irreversible experiment on our planet, and our descendants will live with the consequences of this experiment for centuries to come.</p>

<p>All faith traditions share a concern for the human community, especially its most vulnerable members.  They also share a concern for the biosphere upon which all animals and plants depend for life. Human caused climate change carries major challenges for every aspect of human existence, virtually all of which have ethical dimensions. There is, for instance, the difference in ability of rich and poor nations to deal with issues of international justice, such as the inevitable rise in sea levels.  The disappearance of island nations and extensive river-deltas will exacerbate the already troublesome problem of ecologically forced migration. Furthermore, people who have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions are likely to pay the highest price, such as is true of the hundreds of millions who rely on shrinking glaciers for their supply of fresh water.</p>

<p>We, the undersigned clergy from many different religious traditions, believe that the scientific consensus about human-caused climate change demands a response from the religious community. We believe that the consensus on climate change and its implications should be communicated to and understood by every member of our various faith traditions.</p>

<p>We urge elected officials to educate themselves about climate science and refrain from using false uncertainty as a political tool for inaction. We urge teachers and school board members to preserve the integrity of climate science in classrooms.  We urge students, parents and members of the community to educate themselves about the seriousness of the threats posed by climate change to human civilization and the biosphere upon which all life depends. We make this plea on the basis of a call to pursue the common good of all.</p>
